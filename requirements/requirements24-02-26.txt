Fixed by: Added withInMemoryScrolling configuration to router with scrollPositionRestoration: 'top' in app.config.ts

Issue 2:
For Capture the Shapes, rework the placement of variants and the board so the UI is more interactive and easy to navigate.

Issue 3:
For users who are not logged in, remove the dynamic flip behavior in Chess Lab puzzles because it appears empty; show a normal static block instead of a white screen on hover.
Also, before login, the Quiz should be accessible in the navigation bar.

Issue 4:
Replace the current email/password login and signup flow with "Continue with Google" only authentication. Remove email verification process entirely and streamline authentication to Google sign-in only.

Add both USA Amazon link and India Amazon link for books (support both regional Amazon stores).
