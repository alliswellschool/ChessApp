1. Alphabets (a to h) to be in center of the squares. Now they seem to be on the border of 2 squares.
2. Timer option to be removed from co-ordinates game.
3. Also the message "Session over — Score: 2 / 2 (100%)", to be removed from co-ordinates game.
4. Alphabet should be in small case (for example "Target: a1". Instead of target, we shall name it as "Identify: a1".
5. Also, we can have at the top of the board instead of left side.
6. Accuracy can also be removed / not shown to the user.

7. Allowing to place 9th Queen even after 8 correct placements.

8. Can we have the "How to play" part in Knight's tour at the top of the board, instead of left.

9. Also, can we add "How to play" section for all the games/puzzles. What is your suggestion on this?

10. For capture the shapes, can we directly place the piece at the starting position? (Instead of mentioning start at a1, b1, etc).
11. I guess more positions to be added in capture the shapes. Is that right? I see only 6 puzzles for a piece.

Message: Congratulations! All 8 Queens were placed in the correct squares.
Capital Q, with 's' at the end.
